                    My names Tasnim Ferdous. I'm a third-year computer science student at Farmingdale State College, NY, with a passion
                    for building scalable and efficient backend systems. My primary focus, especially career-wise, is backend development where I'm pursuing interests
                    in <span style={{color: "#cd75ff"}}>distributed systems</span>, <span style={{color: "#cd75ff"}}>high-performance computing</span>, 
                    and <span style={{color: "#cd75ff"}}>API development</span>. Alongside that, I also occasionally dabble in full-stack development.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    On campus, I hold leadership roles across various organizationsâ€”primarily the Artificial Intelligence Club @ FSC where I, along with my fellow officers,
                    have built an active community of 50+ members for those with a shared interest in A.I.

                    When I'm not coding, you can find me going on long-distance runs, playing video games, traveling, or learning a new skill for fun (lately, creative coding).
