                        My names Tasnim Ferdous. I&apos;m a third-year computer science student at Farmingdale State College, NY, with a passion
                        for building scalable and efficient backend systems. My primary focus, especially career-wise, is backend development where I&apos;m pursuing interests
                        in <span style={{fontWeight: 900, color: "#bda2fa"}}>distributed systems</span>, <span style={{fontWeight: 900, color: "#bda2fa"}}>high-performance computing</span>, 
                        and <span style={{fontWeight: 900, color: "#bda2fa"}}>API development</span>. Alongside that, I also occasionally dabble in full-stack development.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        On campus, I hold leadership roles across various organizationsâ€”primarily the Artificial Intelligence Club @ FSC where I, along with my fellow officers,
                        have built an active community of 50+ members for those with a shared interest in A.I.

                        When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me going on long-distance runs, playing video games, traveling, or learning a new skill for fun (lately, creative coding).
